## Introduction

Chemical Exchange is a very lightweight progression/questing modpack based around the mods Alchemistry and ProjectE. This pack puts a new spin on the typical ProjectE experience; in this modpack the only items you can exchange with the transmutation capabilities of ProjectE are chemical elements (oxygen, hydrogen, iron, etc). The general progression of this pack draws inspiration from my other modpack Antimatter Chemistry, so if you've played that pack this pack may feel like a condensed version of it.

Coming in at about 100 mods, this pack loads quick and performs well on potato computers, but still remains a unique hand-crafted and engaging experience that can provide dozens of hours of fun.
Please submit issues and suggestions to this repo for my modpack [Chemical Exchange](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/chemical-exchange).
